# Contribution Guide 

## Contributing to the Code 

1. Fork the repository 
2. Create a new branch with a meaningful name 
3. Commit with a meaningful commit message that starts with a verb in simple present. 
    Example:     "update readme" and NOT "I have updated readme" or "Updating readme" 
4. Push to your own fork 5. Do a pull request to the original repo 

### Remarks: 
* Do not merge into master unless the code is running fine 
* Do commit even if the code is not running perfectly at least once a day to a non master branch 
* Use camelCase for variable names * Write a comment block for every function you create that describes:     
    * What the function does     
    * What are its inputs     
    * What are its outputs 
    
## Contributing with Issues 

* Write an issue for every single thing. This creates information for the upcoming users. 
* When writing an issue, first put a filter. E.g. 
    * "[documentation] Guide line X describes a wrong use case"     
    * "[robot-arm] Robot arm gets stuck at 88 degress and cannot move to 90 degrees"
